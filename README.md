This are some scripts and other stuff which get included in every release
of the sweetp server.

*   auto start the server on login in a
    [(GNU) screen](http://aperiodic.net/screen/quick_reference).
    This way you can attach to the screen and easily
    *   kill the server and start it with a different log level
    *   see the log output
    *   search in the scrollback buffer of screen
    *   copy text out of the logs to post it in the webs
    *   ...
*   simple
    [zsh](http://friedcpu.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/zsh-the-last-shell-youll-ever-need/)
    function which is more powerfull than a simple alias
